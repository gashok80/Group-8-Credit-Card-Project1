     1. Credit card transaction data analysis and observations about fraudulent transactions.

     3. The information provided includes data about transactions times, amounts, related merchant/customer information and            whether the transaction is classified as fraudulent or not.
     4. Our goal is analysis credit card transaction data and make observations about fraudulent transactions.
     5. Identify unusual transaction patterns that deviate from normal behavior to detect potential fraud early. Employ               anomaly detection techniques to spot outliers and suspicious activities.
     6. Classify transactions into categories such as grocery or entertainment to understand spending behaviors. This helps in         improving recommendation systems by identifying transaction categories and preferences.
     7. Examine how factors like transaction amount, merchant type, and time influence spending behavior. Study the                    relationships between user demographics and transaction patterns.

     1. Does the amount of fraud increase or decrease depending on time of year?
     2. Do scammers target areas with higher spending power?
     3. Is there ways to avoid fraud?
