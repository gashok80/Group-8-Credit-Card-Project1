# Group-8-Credit-Card-Project1
Credit card transaction data analysis and observations about fraudulent transactions. 
We looked at both of the resource sites and then with the assistance of Cenan we settled on dataset - Credit Card Transaction Dataset 
(site link)
We considered the dataset suitable:- 
good coverage - (> 1.2 M records)
Availability of date/time fields.
Coverage extends over a span of 1.5 yrs (Jan 2019 to June 2020.)
The information provided includes data about transactions times, amounts, related merchant/customer information and whether the transaction is classified as fraudulent or not.
Initial exploration with the team to review data available and potential outcomes
Worked in silo to further review the dataset and detect trends, patterns and anomalies.
Team reconvened to review findings and to determine trends and patterns of significance. 
The above steps were repeated until a set of visualizations were selected.
